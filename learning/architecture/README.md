# Power Apps Test Engine Architecture Learn Module Overview

## Overview

The Power Well Architected (PoWA) framework is designed to help organizations build and maintain robust, secure, and efficient Power Platform solutions. Automated testing plays a crucial role in this framework by ensuring that solutions are resilient, secure, operationally excellent, and performant. By integrating automated tests into the development lifecycle, organizations can continuously validate their solutions against best practices and quickly identify and address issues.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

Understand the importance of automated testing within the Power Well Architected framework.
Apply best practices for designing automated tests to ensure the reliability and resilience of Power Platform solutions.

- Implement automated security tests to protect your Power Platform workloads.
- Achieve operational excellence through continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines that include automated testing.
- Optimize the performance of your Power Platform solutions by using automated tests to verify performance criteria.

This approach ensures that automated testing is an integral part of the PoWA framework, helping organizations maintain high-quality Power Platform solutions. Let me know if you need any further details or adjustments!

## Modules

As we carry out this stream of work looking at how learnings can be applied to the [Power Well Architected (POWA)](https://aka.ms/powa), it will be important to scale the impact to a wider audience. The key pillars we will focus on are:

1. **Reliability** – How the tests support resiliency, availability, and recovery.
2. **Security** – How tests can be used to mitigate security role and setup related issues in the setup and refactoring process. Key in this process will be profiles with different applied security roles.
3. **Operational Excellence** – This will be a key pillar demonstrating how tests are a quality gate as part of the Azure DevOps CI/CD process.
4. **Performance Efficiency** – Use tests to verify the solution works within expected performance criteria using executable tests.

This module includes the following topics:
- Introduction to Power Well Architected (PoWA) framework
- Importance of automated testing in PoWA
- Designing automated tests for reliability and resilience
- Implementing automated security tests
- Achieving operational excellence with CI/CD and automated testing
- Optimizing performance with automated tests
