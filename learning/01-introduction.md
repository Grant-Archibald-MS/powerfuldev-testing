# Introduction

As a business leader or low-code maker who supports the business, you need to ensure the reliability, performance, and security of your Power Platform solutions. This means you can't rely solely on manual testing processes, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. You want to build a solution that quickly meets your business needs while ensuring high quality. The Power Apps Test Engine can help you achieve this without writing extensive code.

In this workshop, youâ€™ll learn how to:

- Understand the importance of automated testing in low-code development, ensuring your solutions are reliable and secure.
- Utilize the Power Apps Test Engine to automate your testing processes, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.
- Leverage AI capabilities to enhance your testing strategies, providing intelligent insights and automating repetitive tasks.
- Record and run tests for your deployed applications, ensuring they perform as expected in real-world scenarios.
- Use Power Fx statements to create comprehensive test scenarios, validating the functionality and performance of your applications.
- Address known issues and limitations, ensuring your testing processes are robust and effective.

By the end of this workshop, you'll be equipped with the knowledge and tools to implement automated testing in your Power Platform solutions, helping you deliver high-quality applications quickly and efficiently.

## Pre-requisites

Before you get started depending on being an early adopter, beta tester or general availability user from [Ring Deployment Model](../context/ring-deployment-model.md) you will require different components installed to enable you to use this learning module.

### Inner Ring (Canary Users)

Follow the instructions on [Get Started Now](../context/get-started-now.md) ensure that you have the tools installs, verification checks and the source code cloned and compiled on your local machine.

Once the pac test run command is updated `pac test run` will be able to use instead of local compiled version of the Power Apps Test Engine.

### Second Ring (Beta Testers)

Currently the features of Test Engine are not available for second ring (beta testers). The features required will soon be available using the Power Platform Command Line and enabling the Experimental namespace. 

Once the pac test run command is updated we will update setup notes here
