## Abstract

Join us at the Powerful Devs Conference 2025 for an in-depth session on automated testing within the Power Platform. This session will address the common challenges of automated testing in projects and provide valuable insights into pragmatic approaches for testing and monitoring both low-code and pro-code solutions. Learn how to build robust applications, flows, and Copilot solutions with comprehensive unit and integration tests. Discover how to integrate quality and review gates into your CI/CD process, perform operational checks, and validate system dependencies. We will also explore how to apply engineering excellence principles to both code-first and low-code development.

## Possible Topics

Topics that could be discussed include:
1. Building Apps, Flows, and Copilot with Unit/Integration Tests: Learn how to create and implement unit and integration tests for your Power Apps, Power Automate flows, and Copilot solutions.

2. Integrating Quality and Review Gates in CI/CD: Understand how to build in quality and review gates that fit seamlessly with your CI/CD process.

3. Operational Checks and System Validation: Explore methods for performing operational checks and validating system dependencies to ensure reliability.

4. Engineering Excellence for Code-First and Low-Code Makers: Apply engineering excellence principles to enhance the quality and maintainability of your solutions.

5. Real-World Examples from the CoE Kit: Gain insights from real-world examples of automating the installation and testing of various Power Apps, Power Automate, Dataverse, and AI components within the CoE Kit.
