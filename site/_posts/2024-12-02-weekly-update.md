### Roadmap Alignment: Managed Operations at Ignite 2024

At Ignite 2024, Nirav Shah introduced Managed Operations for Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform. This new suite of capabilities empowers organizations to build, deploy, and operate critical workloads with stability and minimal disruption. Key highlights include the Power Apps Test Engine, updates to the CoE Kit, and significant investments in Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) fundamentals. Managed Operations is designed to help control, approve, oversee, and audit changes to applications running in production, ensuring business continuity and support for changes in load while maintaining high-quality standards.

### Ignite: Introducing Managed Operations

Managed Operations is a new pillar introduced to help control, approve, oversee, and audit changes to applications running in production. It includes capabilities for testing, validating, integrating with source control, application lifecycle management, rich monitoring, and extended backup retention. The goal is to ensure business continuity and support changes in load while maintaining high-quality standards. The Test Engine is part of the application lifecycle management capabilities, integrating with pipelines and Native Source Control, as well as Solution Checker, to ensure high-quality capabilities.

### Ignite: Deep Dive: Create, Monitor, and Optimize Enterprise Apps

In the recent Microsoft Ignite session, Austin Laugesen and Marc Schweigert took a deep dive into the importance of automated testing in creating, monitoring, and optimizing enterprise-grade applications with Power Apps. This session highlighted the critical role that automated testing plays in ensuring the reliability and performance of applications that businesses depend on. The session used a compelling analogy comparing Power Apps to paper airplanes and commercial airplanes to explain the difference between simple apps and enterprise-grade applications. The overall lifecycle of an enterprise-grade application presented included demonstrations of planning, building, and testing phases, with automated testing being a key step for ensuring reliability and performance.
