As I look at software testing of low code Power Platform, I was paging back through Alan, Ken, and BJ's "How We Test Software at Microsoft" published in 2009. It's fascinating how many of the concepts from over 15 years ago are incredibly relevant today even as the technology changes. But how do we take this body of knowledge and scale it to new groups or people outside the traditional software testing role?

One way we have been exploring is by leveraging low code languages like Power Fx combined with new the power of Generative AI to make testing more accessible to a wider group of people. By democratizing testing, we can empower more individuals to contribute to the quality and reliability of software, regardless of their technical background.

What are your thoughts on making low code software testing more inclusive and accessible? Let's discuss!
