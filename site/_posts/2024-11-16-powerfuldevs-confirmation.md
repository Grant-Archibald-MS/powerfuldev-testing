To support and shape this session, I've created this dedicated site offering greater context, discussion topics, and examples using the CoE Starter Kit as we apply Automated Testing to the solution.

💡 Why This Matters: Automated testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability, security, and performance of Power Platform solutions especially as they scale enterprise wide. By integrating these practices, we can deliver more robust applications with fewer bugs.

🔍 What You'll Find:
- In-depth discussions on automated testing
- Practical examples and use cases
- Insights from the [Power CAT Engineering team](https://aka.ms/whoispowercat)

I would love to get your feedback and hear your thoughts on this topic. How do you see automated testing shaping the future of low-code development?

Looking forward to an engaging session next year and continuing the conversation with all of you!
