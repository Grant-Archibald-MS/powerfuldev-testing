## Managed Operations

Managed Operations is a suite of capabilities designed to empower organizations to build, deploy, and operate their most critical workloads. It includes features like the Power Apps Test Engine, which simplifies testing and maximizes the reliability of applications, flows, and agents in production.

## CoE Kit Updates

The CoE Kit is being updated to align with these new enhancements, driving the need for more automated testing. This transformation is supported by our Power CAT Engineering team's strategy to enhance [ALM fundamentals](/powerfuldev-testing/examples/coe-kit-test-automation-alm.md) improving deployment processes and incorporating automated tests.

## Conclusion

Our roadmap alignment with content for the PowerfulDevs Conference and CoE Starter ALM testing process provides an example that reflects our commitment to building scalable, supportable, and high-quality solutions on the Power Platform. We look forward to sharing our progress and insights as we continue to enhance the CoE Starter Kit and our overall testing practices.
