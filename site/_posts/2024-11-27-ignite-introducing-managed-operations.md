Managed Operations is a new pillar introduced to help control, approve, oversee, and audit changes to applications running in production. It includes capabilities for testing, validating, integrating with source control, application lifecycle management, rich monitoring, and extended backup retention. The goal is to ensure business continuity and support changes in load while maintaining high-quality standards.

### Managed Operations and Test Engine

The Test Engine is part of the application lifecycle management capabilities. It integrates with pipelines and Native Source Control, as well as Solution Checker, to ensure that the capabilities being built are of high quality. This helps in validating and testing the applications before they are deployed, ensuring they meet the required standards and perform reliably

### Key Concepts

**Application Lifecycle Management:**
Managed Operations builds upon existing capabilities with pipelines and integrates deeply with Native Source Control, Solution Checker, and Test Engine to ensure high-quality capabilities.

**Monitoring and Observability:**
The Monitoring Hub provides advanced diagnostics directly within the product and integrates with tools like Azure Application Insights.

**Data Resilience:**
Managed Operations offers a broad set of data resilience capabilities, including Long-term Retention and Recycle Bin.
