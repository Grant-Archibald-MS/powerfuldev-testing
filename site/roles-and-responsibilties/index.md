This section provides an overview of various roles involved in low-code testing on the Power Platform. Each role has unique responsibilities and contributions to ensure the success of low-code solutions. Select role names to learn more about their specific responsibilities and how they can effectively contribute to the organization's goals.

While the PowerfulDevs session is more focused on Software Engineering and Advanced makers, by exploring understanding how each role to understand their specific responsibilities and how they contribute to the success of low-code solutions on the Power Platform can help provide more context on the role of Automated testing.

NOTE: The roles and responsibility section is an area under review and update. We look forward to working with you to refine and improve this section to help support the role of Automated Testing in our organization.
