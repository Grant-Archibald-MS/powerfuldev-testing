# Getting Started

When it comes to Power Platform Automated Testing, where you start will depend on your <a href="/powerfuldev-testing/roles-and-responsibilities">role in the organization</a> and your willingness to work as an early adopter. This guide will help you navigate the key items to consider as you embark on this journey.

By understanding your role and the steps involved, you can determine when and how to effectively contribute to the successful implementation of automated testing within your organization. 

We are looking forward to working with you to embrace the journey and be part of the innovation that drives the Power Platform forward.

## Business Roles

### Business Users

[Business users](/powerfuldev-testing/roles-and-responsibilties#business-roles#business-roles) should familiarize themselves with relevant business roles and start planning where automated testing can help with their business processes. Understanding the potential impact and benefits of automated testing will be crucial in identifying areas for improvement and efficiency.

### Architects

[Architects](/powerfuldev-testing/roles-and-responsibilties#technical-roles) should begin by looking at the available information and considering how automated testing can be integrated into their Power Platform solutions. This involves evaluating the current architecture and identifying opportunities to enhance it with automated testing practices.

### Security Architects

[Security architects](/powerfuldev-testing/roles-and-responsibilties#risk-and-compliance) need to review the available security information and determine how automated testing can fit into the range of tools and processes they monitor. Ensuring that automated testing aligns with security protocols and standards is essential for maintaining a secure environment.

### Software Engineers and Advanced Makers

[Software engineers and advanced makers](/powerfuldev-testing/roles-and-responsibilties#technical-roles) have the option to decide whether they want to be involved as early adopters. They can choose to use the early components and provide feedback or wait for the in-product release. Early adopters play a critical role in shaping the development and refinement of new features.

#### Early Adopter

As an early adopter, consider reaching out to the [Power CAT](../roles-and-responsibilities/powercat.md) by giving us [feedback](https://aka.ms/powerfuldevs/testing/feedback) that you would like collaborate. We can discuss our experiences with the [CoE Starter Kit](../examples/coe-kit-automate-test-sample.md) to see how it could help you with using the current source code version of Power Apps Test Engine and prioritizing your feedback.

#### In Product Usage

Many of the features discussed in this site cover in development features. As features complete product reviews, future builds of the [Power Platform Command Line Interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/test) will include these new features. This approach allows for continuous improvement and integration of the latest advancements in automated testing.

Continue to watch [Roadmap](../context/roadmap-alignment.md) for expected time line and watch for updates of new features that can be used with updates to the command line tools.

#### Ring Deployment Model

It's important to note that there will be a ring deployment model for new features. Initially, features will be classified as Experimental and will undergo wider adoption and verification in various test cases and customer scenarios before being promoted to broader usage. This phased approach ensures that features are thoroughly tested and refined before reaching a larger audience.

### Power CAT's Role

<a href="/powerfuldev-testing/roles-and-responsibilities/powercat">Power CAT</a> is an early adopter, utilizing a [build-from-source strategy](../examples/coe-kit-build-from-source-run-tests.md) and working closely and contributing towards he success of Engineering teams responsible for Automated Testing in the Power Platform.
