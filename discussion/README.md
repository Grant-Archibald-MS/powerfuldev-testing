# Welcome to the Mastering Automated Testing in Power Platform: From Unit Tests to CI/CD Integration Discussion Section!

Hello, Code First Developers!

Welcome to our community-driven discussions repository, where we dive deep into topics around the proposed Powerful Devs session "Mastering Automated Testing in Power Platform: From Unit Tests to CI/CD Integration",  where we look at testing to low code Power Platform resources. This folder is designed to foster a starting point for engaging discussions, were articles can be used to share insights, and collaboratively explore how testing concepts can be effectively applied to the solutions you build and maintain.

## Why Testing Matters

In the realm of low code development, testing is often an overlooked yet crucial aspect. Ensuring the reliability, performance, and security of your Power Platform solutions can significantly enhance their quality and user satisfaction. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, understanding and implementing robust testing strategies is key to delivering top-notch applications.

## Discussion Topics

Topics could be on a variety of topics, including but not limited to:

- **Tool Selection**: What tools to pick and why considerations might you need to make?
- **Unit Testing**: How can we apply unit testing principles to Power Apps and Power Automate flows?
- **Integration Testing**: What are the best practices for testing integrations with other systems and services?
- **Security Testing**: What strategies can we use to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities?
- **Automated Testing**: When should you and how can we leverage automated testing tools to streamline our testing processes?
- **CI/CD**: How to integrate these concepts into your build and release process and how does this affect your operations model.
