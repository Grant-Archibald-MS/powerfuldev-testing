# Welcome to the Mastering Automated Testing in Power Platform: From Unit Tests to CI/CD Integration Discussion Section!

Hello, Code First Developers!

Welcome to our community-driven discussions repository, where we dive deep into topics around the proposed Powerful Devs session "Mastering Automated Testing in Power Platform: From Unit Tests to CI/CD Integration",  where we look at testing to low code Power Platform resources. This folder is designed to foster a starting point for engaging discussions, were articles can be used to share insights, and collaboratively explore how testing concepts can be effectively applied to the solutions you build and maintain.

## Why Testing Matters

In the realm of low code development, testing is often an overlooked yet crucial aspect. Ensuring the reliability, performance, and security of your Power Platform solutions can significantly enhance their quality and user satisfaction. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, understanding and implementing robust testing strategies is key to delivering top-notch applications.

## Discussion Topics

### Current Topics

| Article | Notes | Feedback |
|---------|-------|----------|
[Building a Sustainability Model](/discussion/building-a-sustainability-model.md) | In the fast-paced world of software development, the initial rush of quickly building and deploying a solution can be exhilarating. However, the true challenge lies in keeping your great idea alive and ensuring its sustainability over time. This discussion explores how to build a sustainability model that not only keeps your solution relevant but also engages the community and stakeholders in the process. | [Link](https://github.com/Grant-Archibald-MS/powerfuldev-testing/issues/5)
[Introduction to Testing Approaches](/discussion/introduction-to-testing-approaches.md) | Read discussion and give your feedback on the concepts of automated testing looking at concepts like black box and white box testing for Power Apps, including Canvas Apps, Custom Pages, and Model Driven Applications. We'll explore the importance of state management, connectors, workflows, and Dataverse state, and how to effectively test these components. | [Link](https://github.com/Grant-Archibald-MS/powerfuldev-testing/issues/4)
[Low Code Power Platform Testing for the Code First Developer](discussion/low-code-testing-for-code-first-developer.md) | This article is intended as a starter for discussion and contains content that is under development. It is based on experiences from teams like the Power CAT Engineering team as they apply low code testing principles to the low code Power Platform solutions they build and maintain. Ideally, this discussion serves as a great starting point to foster collaboration and gain input to help shape low code automation and engineering excellence in the wider low code Power Platform community. | [Link](https://github.com/Grant-Archibald-MS/powerfuldev-testing/issues/2)
[Playwright vs Power Apps Test Engine](discussion/playwright-vs-test-engine.md) | When it comes to testing low-code Power Platform applications, a common question arises: why not just use Playwright to directly test a Power App rather than using the Power Apps Test Engine? This discussion aims to explore the strengths and limitations of both tools and provide insights into their best use cases. | [Link](https://github.com/Grant-Archibald-MS/powerfuldev-testing/issues/1)

### Future Topics

Possible future topics could be on a variety of topics, including but not limited to:

- **Tool Selection**: What tools to pick and why considerations might you need to make?
- **Unit Testing**: How can we apply unit testing principles to Power Apps and Power Automate flows?
- **Integration Testing**: What are the best practices for testing integrations with other systems and services?
- **Security Testing**: What strategies can we use to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities?
- **Automated Testing**: When should you and how can we leverage automated testing tools to streamline our testing processes?
- **CI/CD**: How to integrate these concepts into your build and release process and how does this affect your operations model.
